### Lessons Learned
Data manipulation through specific class' rather than manipulating data through the main class. I have a better understanding of class hierarchy and Object Oriented Design principals after writing this program.

### Usage
This program was written with the thought of being able to reuse classes in other programs. The Card, Suit, Rank, and Hand classes can be reused to create other card based games. To use this program, just download the code and run it within your own IDE.
